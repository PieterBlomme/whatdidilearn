Research database built to keep track of papers read.  


It is possible to:
- save papers to your personal library
- add tags to group papers
- add comments/notes
- add scores on benchmarks (either public, eg. Imagenet or your own personal benchmarks)

Library and tags are always public.  Comments and benchmarks default to public, but can be set to private if you do not want to share.  

You can browse other users' library and for a given paper check the public notes and benchmarks of others.

This was a personal side-project, as I needed a way to organise my research.  I'm releasing it online because I feel that there is value in seeing what other's are reading and what their take-aways from papers are.
